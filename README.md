# Install-Exchange15

## Getting Started

This script can install Exchange 2013/2016/2019 prerequisites, optionally create the Exchange
organization (prepares Active Directory) and installs Exchange Server. When the AutoPilot switch is
specified, it will do all the required rebooting and logon using provided credentials, performing
setup in between required reboots.

For more information on this script, as well as usage and examples, see
the related blog article, [Exchange v15 Unattended Setup](https://eightwone.com/2013/02/18/exchange-2013-unattended-installation-script/).
